\documentclass[conference]{IEEEtran}
% Some Computer Society conferences also require the compsoc mode option,
% but others use the standard conference format.
%
% If IEEEtran.cls has not been installed into the LaTeX system files,
% manually specify the path to it like:
% \documentclass[conference]{../sty/IEEEtran}





% Some very useful LaTeX packages include:
% (uncomment the ones you want to load)


% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/ifpdf
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of the IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 5.0 (2009-03-20) and later if using hyperref.sty.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/cite
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi

% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics.
%
% Note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/amsmath





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as the IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithms
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithmicx




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/array


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a larger sans serif font
% than the serif footnote size font used in traditional IEEE formatting
% and thus the need to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending
% on whether compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/subfig




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure.
% Be aware that LaTeX2e kernels dated 2015 and later have fixltx2e.sty's
% corrections already built into the system in which case a warning will
% be issued if an attempt is made to load fixltx2e.sty as it is no longer
% needed.
% The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that the IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as the IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/dblfloatfix




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/url
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.




% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

\begin{abstract}
Digital Predistortion (DPD) is a popular technique for linearizing a power amplifier (PA) to help reduce the spurious emissions and spectral regrowth. DPD requires the learning of the inverse PA nonlinearities by training on the output of the PA. In practical systems, the analog output of the PA will have to go through an analog-to-digital converter (ADC) so that training can be done on a digital processor. The quantization degrades signal quality and may limit performance of a DPD learning algorithm. However, a lower resolution ADC may cost less and allow for less computational complexity in the digital processing. We study this tradeoff to try to find how much precision is needed in DPD systems.

\section{Introduction}
The power amplifier (PA) is a component of wireless systems that has a nonlinear transfer function. 
The nonlinearities are undesirable in that they lead to distortions such as spectral regrowth around the main carriers and intermodulation distortions (IMDs) in scenarios with multiple, noncontiguous carriers. 
This is exacerbated with modern signals such as OFDM with high PAPR. 

Digital predistortion (DPD) is a method for linearizing a power amplifier (PA). 
With DPD, the nonlinearities are estimated so that they can be corrected before the PA with their inverse.
To do this, we must train our predistorter by observing the signal after the PA.
In practical situations, we need a feedback bath after the PA that has a downconverter and an ADC.
For wide bandwidth signals, the sampling rate of the ADC must be fast.
In mobile applications where power and cost are a concern, one option for reducing the complexity of the system is to use a low precision ADC. By reducing the precision, the DPD algrothim can be performed with shorter word lengths which would save area and power in an implementation. Low precision ADCs are usually cheaper and consume less power. Moreover, ADCs that support a faster sampling rate are often lower precision.   

This is a common thing being explored in MMWave and massive MIMO

In this paper, we test the performance of our previous DPD solutions for varying ADC precision. 

\section{Full-Band DPD}
Most DPD is a variation of what we refer to as full-band DPD where the entire transmit band near the main carriers is linearized. 
This can reduce the magnitude of multiple spurious emissions such as the third and fifth intermodulation products and the spectral regrowth around the main carriers. 
However, this comes with a considerable computational complexity especially as the spacing between the carriers becomes large.
Moreover, the cost of the ADC rapidly increases as the sampling rate grows.

One potential way to ease this cost and reduce complexity with only a small loss in performance is to reduce the precision of the ADC. We illustrate this in Figure \ref{fullbandpsd}. Here, we have two noncontiguous signals like what may be found in LTE-Advanced carrier aggregation. They are each 5 MHz in bandwidth. They are broadcast through a fifth-order, nonlinear PA model with memory effects implemented in \textsc{Matlab}. Intermodulation occurs occurs and introduces large spurious emissions through the nearby spectrum as seen by the black curve.

When we perform the DPD algorithm where the feedback into the DPD learning block is the full, double-precision values computed by \textsc{Matlab}, we get suppression shown by the solid blue curve. We then use \textsc{Matlab}'s fixed point toolbox to convert the values to a signed, fixed-point representation. This introduces quantization noise and degrades the performance. However, for as low as 6-bit ADC, the performance degradation is mostly insignificant. For example, there is only a 2 dB difference in suppression on the right-hand IM3 spur. The 4-bit ADC still suppress throughout the spectrum, but there is a significant performance degradation (14 dB on the right-hand IM3). 


\begin{figure}[]

\includegraphics[]{FullBandPSD}
\caption{PSD output when performing full-band DPD on a scenario with two, noncontiguous, 5 MHz LTE uplink carrier with a low precision ADC feedback path. Here, performance for the 8 bit and 6 bit ADCs are similar with about 2 dB less IM3 suppression when compared to the double precision PA simulation.}
\label{fullbandpsd}
\end{figure}


\section{Sub-Band DPD}
An alternative to the full-band DPD is what the authors refer to as sub-band DPD. With this method, one targets specific sub-bands such as an intermodulation product to suppress. This has the effect of drastically reducing sample rates which in turn reduces the running complexity of the algorithm. This method also provides freedom in the sense that specific sub-bands can be targeted as needed. 

The complexity can further be reduced if we limit the resolution of the ADC.

\includegraphics[]{SubBandPSD}
\caption{PSD output when performing sub-band DPD on a scenario with two, noncontiguous, 1.4 MHz LTE uplink carriers with a low precision ADC feedback path. Here, performance for 8, 6, and 4 bit observations are similar with about 2 dB less IM3 suppression when compared to the double precision PA simulation. }

\section{Conclusion}
Digital predistortion is a valuable method to linearize PAs that does not need to be computationally costly and does not require a complicated hardware overhead. When designing a system with DPD, one consideration should be the width of the ADC. With a low precision ADC with a resolution of four or six bits, the performance of the DPD training can remain mostly intact.
